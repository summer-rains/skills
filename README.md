- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- A [千图AI open platform](https://ai.58pic.com) account
- API Key **or** OAuth login (the skill will guide you through setup)

## Quick start

After installing, invoke the skill in your AI IDE:

```
/58pic-generate generate a serene mountain lake at sunset
/58pic-assets search Spring Festival poster templates
/58pic-models list image models
/58pic-account check my credits
/58pic-library list my favorite folders and my recent AI creations
/58pic-workflow list my workflows and inspect the canvas before editing
```

The skills will:
1. Check / install the `58pic` CLI automatically
2. Guide you through authentication (API Key or OAuth)
3. Route generation, asset search, model discovery, account, and "my data" (favorites / downloads / generation history) tasks to focused workflows

## Authentication

| Method | Command | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| API Key | `58pic config init --api-key sk_…` | Fastest — one command |
| OAuth | `58pic auth login` | No API key; browser-based login |
